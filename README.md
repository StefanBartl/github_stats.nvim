GitHub keeps clones, views, referrers and paths for **fourteen days** and then
throws them away. This plugin collects them in the background before that
happens, analyses the history it builds, and exports it — all from inside
Neovim.

---

## Around it

> **[reposcope.nvim](https://github.com/StefanBartl/reposcope.nvim)** — a
> repository browser and switcher. This plugin tells you which of your
> repositories people are actually looking at; reposcope is how you jump into one.
>
> **[insights.nvim](https://github.com/StefanBartl/insights.nvim)** — traffic is
> the outside view of a repository; insights is the inside one.
>
> Both are soft: without them everything else works unchanged.
> [lib.nvim](https://github.com/StefanBartl/lib.nvim) and `curl` are the real
> dependencies — see [Requirements](docs/installation.md#requirements).

## Documentation

Start at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) — what's where, and which question
each page answers.

**The Basics**

- [Requirements](docs/installation.md#requirements) — Neovim version, the `lib.nvim` dependency, `curl`, and the GitHub token.

**Configuration**

- [What you get with the defaults](docs/what-you-get.md) — the commands worth knowing on day one.

- [Dashboard guide](docs/dashboard.md) — the interactive dashboard, its keys, and what it can be configured to show.

**The Rest**
